# NSGA-III-GKM-Framework-for-Multi-Objective-Cloud-Resource-Brokerage-Optimization

# Cloud Brokerage Optimization

This project implements a hybrid **NSGA-III + Genetic K-Means++ (GKM++)** algorithm for optimizing cloud brokerage decisions.

## 📌 Prerequisites

Ensure you have **Python 3.8+** installed. You can check your Python version by running:

```bash
python --version


Setup Virtual Environment
To create and activate a virtual environment:
Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate


Mac/Linux
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate


📦 Install Dependencies
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt


If you don't have a requirements.txt file, create one with the following dependencies:
numpy
matplotlib
pymoo
scikit-learn


▶️ Run the Python Script
Execute the main script:
python main.py


Replace main.py with the actual filename of your script.
❌ Deactivate Virtual Environment
Once you're done, deactivate the virtual environment:
deactivate
